# Manual Contest Tab Categorization Fix

## Issue Fixed
Manual control contests were incorrectly appearing in the "Past Contests" tab because the filtering logic was using `start_date` and `end_date` (which are `null` for manual contests) to determine contest status.

## Root Cause
The contest filtering logic in `ViewContest.js` was using date-based logic for all contests:
```javascript
// OLD LOGIC (BROKEN)
const ongoingContests = contests.filter(contest => 
    new Date(contest.start_date) <= today && new Date(contest.end_date) >= today
);
const pastContests = contests.filter(contest => 
    new Date(contest.end_date) < today
);
```

For manual control contests:
- `start_date` and `end_date` are `null`
- `new Date(null)` returns an invalid date
- Invalid dates are always considered "past"
- Manual contests incorrectly appeared in "Past Contests" tab

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Contest Filtering Logic
```javascript
// NEW LOGIC (FIXED)
const ongoingContests = contests.filter(contest => {
    if (contest.manual_control) {
        // Manual control contests are ongoing if voting is open
        return contest.voting_open;
    } else {
        // Scheduled contests are ongoing if within date range
        return new Date(contest.start_date) <= today && new Date(contest.end_date) >= today;
    }
});

const pastContests = contests.filter(contest => {
    if (contest.manual_control) {
        // Manual control contests are past if voting is closed
        return !contest.voting_open;
    } else {
        // Scheduled contests are past if end date has passed
        return new Date(contest.end_date) < today;
    }
});

const upcomingContests = contests.filter(contest => {
    if (contest.manual_control) {
        // Manual control contests are never "upcoming"
        return false;
    } else {
        // Scheduled contests are upcoming if start date is in the future
        return new Date(contest.start_date) > today;
    }
});
```

### 2. Updated Contest Display
- **Manual Control Contests**: Show "Type: Manual Control Contest" instead of dates
- **Scheduled Contests**: Show start and end dates as before
- **Status Indicator**: Shows "Voting Open" or "Voting Closed" for all contests
- **Manual Control Badge**: Shows "Manual Control" badge for manual contests

### 3. Updated Button Logic
- **Manual Control Contests**: Buttons based on `voting_open` status
- **Scheduled Contests**: Buttons based on date ranges as before

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Manual Contest - Voting Open
1. Create a manual control contest
2. Start voting (set `voting_open: true`)
3. **Expected Result**: Contest appears in "Ongoing Contests" tab
4. **Expected Display**: Shows "Voting Open" and "Manual Control" badge
5. **Expected Buttons**: "View" and "Join" buttons available

### Test 2: Manual Contest - Voting Closed
1. Create a manual control contest
2. Stop voting (set `voting_open: false`)
3. **Expected Result**: Contest appears in "Past Contests" tab
4. **Expected Display**: Shows "Voting Closed" and "Manual Control" badge
5. **Expected Buttons**: "Contest Not Started" button (disabled)

### Test 3: Scheduled Contest - Ongoing
1. Create a scheduled contest with current dates
2. **Expected Result**: Contest appears in "Ongoing Contests" tab
3. **Expected Display**: Shows start and end dates
4. **Expected Buttons**: "View" and "Join" buttons available

### Test 4: Scheduled Contest - Future
1. Create a scheduled contest with future dates
2. **Expected Result**: Contest appears in "Upcoming Contests" tab
3. **Expected Display**: Shows start and end dates
4. **Expected Buttons**: "Wait" button (disabled)

### Test 5: Scheduled Contest - Past
1. Create a scheduled contest with past dates
2. **Expected Result**: Contest appears in "Past Contests" tab
3. **Expected Display**: Shows start and end dates
4. **Expected Buttons**: "View Winner" button (admin only)

## Contest Tab Logic

### Ongoing Contests Tab
- **Manual Control**: `voting_open === true`
- **Scheduled**: `start_date <= today && end_date >= today`

### Past Contests Tab
- **Manual Control**: `voting_open === false`
- **Scheduled**: `end_date < today`

### Upcoming Contests Tab
- **Manual Control**: Never (always `false`)
- **Scheduled**: `start_date > today`

## Benefits

- ✅ **Correct Categorization**: Manual contests appear in correct tabs
- ✅ **Status-Based Logic**: Uses voting status instead of dates for manual contests
- ✅ **Clear Indicators**: Visual distinction between contest types
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Manual contests behave predictably
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Scheduled contests work as before

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Contest filtering logic updated
- ✅ Contest display updated
- ✅ Button logic updated
- ✅ Status indicators added
- ✅ Manual control badges added
- ✅ Date display conditional logic

## Summary
Manual control contests now correctly appear in the appropriate tabs based on their voting status rather than their (non-existent) scheduled dates. The system properly distinguishes between manual control and scheduled contests throughout the UI.
