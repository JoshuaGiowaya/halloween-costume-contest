# Independent Contest and Voting Controls Test

## Overview
Contest management and voting management are now completely independent. You can start/stop contests without affecting voting, and start/stop voting without affecting contest status.

## New Contest Status System

### Contest Status Values:
- **`not_started`**: Contest has been created but not started
- **`active`**: Contest is running (can accept photos)
- **`ended`**: Contest has been stopped/ended

### Voting Status (Separate):
- **`voting_open: true`**: Voting is enabled
- **`voting_open: false`**: Voting is disabled

## Backend Changes

### Contest Model Updates:
```javascript
const contestSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    // ... existing fields ...
    contest_status: { 
        type: String, 
        enum: ['not_started', 'active', 'ended'], 
        default: 'not_started' 
    },
    voting_open: { type: Boolean, default: false },
    // ... other fields ...
});
```

### New API Endpoints:
- **`POST /api/contests/:title/start`**: Start contest (sets `contest_status: 'active'`)
- **`POST /api/contests/:title/stop`**: Stop contest (sets `contest_status: 'ended'`)
- **`POST /api/contests/:title/voting/start`**: Start voting (sets `voting_open: true`)
- **`POST /api/contests/:title/voting/stop`**: Stop voting (sets `voting_open: false`)

## Frontend Changes

### Admin Dashboard Updates:
- **Separate Controls**: Contest controls and voting controls are now separate
- **Status Display**: Shows both contest status and voting status
- **Independent Buttons**: Start/stop contest and start/stop voting are separate actions

### Contest Display:
- **Contest Status**: Shows "Not Started", "Active", or "Ended"
- **Voting Status**: Shows "Open" or "Closed"
- **Clear Separation**: Visual distinction between contest and voting states

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Create Contest (Not Started)
1. Create a new contest
2. **Expected Result**: 
   - Contest status: "Not Started"
   - Voting status: "Closed"
   - Buttons: "Start Contest" and "Start Voting" available

### Test 2: Start Contest Only
1. Click "Start Contest" button
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Contest status: "Active"
   - Voting status: "Closed" (unchanged)
   - Buttons: "Stop Contest" and "Start Voting" available
   - Contest appears in "Ongoing Contests" tab

### Test 3: Start Voting Only
1. With contest still "Not Started", click "Start Voting"
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Contest status: "Not Started" (unchanged)
   - Voting status: "Open"
   - Buttons: "Start Contest" and "Stop Voting" available

### Test 4: Start Both Contest and Voting
1. Start contest (status: "Active")
2. Start voting (status: "Open")
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Contest status: "Active"
   - Voting status: "Open"
   - Buttons: "Stop Contest" and "Stop Voting" available
   - Users can join and vote

### Test 5: Stop Contest Only
1. With both contest and voting active, click "Stop Contest"
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Contest status: "Ended"
   - Voting status: "Open" (unchanged)
   - Buttons: "Start Contest" and "Stop Voting" available
   - Contest moves to "Past Contests" tab

### Test 6: Stop Voting Only
1. With contest active and voting open, click "Stop Voting"
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Contest status: "Active" (unchanged)
   - Voting status: "Closed"
   - Buttons: "Stop Contest" and "Start Voting" available
   - Contest stays in "Ongoing Contests" tab

### Test 7: Stop Both Contest and Voting
1. With both active, stop contest first, then stop voting
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Contest status: "Ended"
   - Voting status: "Closed"
   - Buttons: "Start Contest" and "Start Voting" available
   - Contest in "Past Contests" tab

## Contest Tab Logic

### Ongoing Contests Tab:
- **Manual Control**: `contest_status === 'active'`
- **Scheduled**: `start_date <= today && end_date >= today`

### Past Contests Tab:
- **Manual Control**: `contest_status === 'ended'`
- **Scheduled**: `end_date < today`

### Upcoming Contests Tab:
- **Manual Control**: `contest_status === 'not_started'`
- **Scheduled**: `start_date > today`

## User Experience

### Contest Creation Flow:
1. **Create Contest**: Status = "Not Started", Voting = "Closed"
2. **Start Contest**: Status = "Active", Voting = "Closed" (contest ready for photos)
3. **Start Voting**: Status = "Active", Voting = "Open" (users can vote)
4. **Stop Voting**: Status = "Active", Voting = "Closed" (voting paused)
5. **Stop Contest**: Status = "Ended", Voting = "Closed" (contest finished)

### Admin Control Options:
- **Contest Only**: Start/stop contest without affecting voting
- **Voting Only**: Start/stop voting without affecting contest
- **Both**: Control contest and voting independently
- **Sequential**: Start contest, then start voting when ready

## Benefits

## API Endpoints Summary

### Contest Management:

- `POST /api/contests/:title/stop` - Stop contest

### Voting Management:

## Implementation Status
- âœ… Contest model updated with status field
- âœ… Separate API endpoints created
- âœ… Frontend controls separated
- âœ… Contest filtering updated
- âœ… Status display enhanced
- âœ… Independent button logic

## Summary
Contest management and voting management are now completely independent. Admins can control contest status and voting status separately, providing much more flexibility in managing contests. The system clearly shows both statuses and provides appropriate controls for each.
